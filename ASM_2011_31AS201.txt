NOTE: For information on confidentiality protection, sampling error, nonsampling error, and definitions, see Survey Methodology. Data in this table represent those available when this report was created. Data may not be available for all NAICS industries or geographies. Detail items may not add to total due to independent rounding.  For information on ASM, see the Annual Survey of Manufactures (ASM) Website.

Data from the 2011 Annual Survey of Manufactures - REFRESH supersede data originally published in the 2011 Annual Survey of Manufactures (ASM). A typical ASM publishes data for two years: the current year, and an updated version of the prior year. Because the Economic Census only publishes one year of data, the ASM REFRESH is released in years ending in 1 and 6 - those preceding the Economic Census - as a means of updating data for those reference periods.
